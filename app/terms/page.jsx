      <h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
      <p>

        Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
      <p>
        SuiteRhythm is a reactive sound design platform for tabletop RPG sessions, storytelling,
        and content creation. The Service analyses spoken audio via your microphone (with your
        permission) and plays contextual music and sound effects from a curated library. Scene
        detection is performed by a language model.
      </p>

      <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for all activity under your account.</li>
        <li>You agree not to misuse, reverse-engineer, or abuse the Service or its APIs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Subscriptions &amp; Payments</h2>
      <p>
        SuiteRhythm is currently offered as a beta preview. Paid subscriptions may be introduced
        later with clear pricing, checkout, renewal, and cancellation terms before any charge is made.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        All sounds, code, and branding are owned by SuiteRhythm or licensed from third parties.
        You may use recordings of your own sessions, streams, and shows, but you may not redistribute
        the raw sound library or package the sounds as a competing library.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; without warranty of any kind. SuiteRhythm is not
        liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from use of the
        Service.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Changes</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these terms at any time. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
